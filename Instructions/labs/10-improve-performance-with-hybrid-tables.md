8. In the **Current Value** box, enter **6/1/2022 (3)** (June 1, 2022 - the VM uses US date formats). 

	![](../images1/dp500-10-16.png)
	
	>**Note**: For non-MM-DD-YYYY format locations, the date should be entered as 1/6/2022.
        >**Note**: While setting up the parameters, you can use arbitrary values. Power BI will update parameter values when it creates and manages the partitions. In this lab, you'll set a range for the month of June 2022.


9. To create a second parameter, select **New**.

10. Set the following parameter properties and click **OK (4)**.

	- Name: **RangeEnd (1)**

	- Type: **Date/Time (2)**

	- Current Value: **7/1/2022 (3)** (July 1, 2022)
	
	  ![](../images1/dp500-10-17.png)
	
	  >**Note**: For non-MM-DD-YYY format locations, the date should be entered as 1/7/2022.

### Task 2: Filter the query

In this task, you will add filters to the **Sales** query.

1. In the **Queries** pane, select the **Sales** query.

2. In the header of the **OrderDate (1)** column, select the down arrow, and then select **Date/Time Filters (2)** > **Between (3)**.

	![](../images1/dp500-10-18.png)

3. In the **Filter Rows** window, select the **first calendar icon** **(1)** dropdown list, and then select **Parameter (2)**, In the adjacent dropdown list, notice that the **RangeStart (3)** parameter is set. 

      ![](../images1/dp500-10-19.png)
      
      ![](../images1/dp500-10-20.png)
	
4. In the second "range" dropdown list, select **is before (1)**. select the **second calendar icon (2)** dropdown list, select **Parameter** and in the corresponding dropdown lists, select the **RangeEnd (3)** parameter. Select **OK (4)**.

	![](../images1/dp500-10-21.png)

	>**Note**: The default parameter selection is the correct one.

5. On the **Home** ribbon tab, from inside the **Close** group, click the **Close &amp; Apply** icon.

	![](../images1/dp500-10-22.png)

6. Notice that Power BI Desktop loaded 5,134 rows into the **Sales** table.

	![](../images1/dp500-10-23.png)
	
2. In the **Incremental refresh and real-time data** window, at step 2, turn on **Incrementally refresh this table (1)**. Set the Archive data starting **2 Years (2)** before the refresh date. Set an Incrementally refresh data starting **7 Days (3)** before the refresh date. At step 3, **check** the **Get the latest data in real time with the DirectQuery (4)** option. Select **Apply (5)**.

      ![](../images1/dp500-10-24.png)
      
	>**Note:Archive sata starting:** This setting determines the historical period. In this instance, Power BI will create two whole-year partitions for historic data.

	>**Note:Incrementally refresh data starting:** This setting determines the incremental refresh period in which all rows with a date/time in that period are included in the refresh partition(s) and refreshed with each refresh operation.

	> **Note:Get the latest data in real time with DirectQuery:** This setting enables fetching the latest changes from the selected table at the data source beyond the incremental refresh period by using DirectQuery. All rows with a date/time later than the incremental refresh period are included in a DirectQuery partition and fetched from the data source with every dataset query. This setting makes the table a hybrid table because it will contain import partitions and one DirectQuery partition.

3. **Save** the Power BI Desktop file.
